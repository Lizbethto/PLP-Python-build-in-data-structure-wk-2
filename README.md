# Python List Operations Assignment
### Introduction
This repository contains a Python program created as part of a class assignment to practice list operations.
The task focused on learning how to create, modify, and manipulate lists using Python's built-in methods.

### Assignment Objective
The aim of this assignment was to:

Understand how to create lists in Python.

Practice using common list methods (append(), insert(), extend(), pop(), sort(), index()).

Gain experience in inserting, extending, and removing list elements.

Learn how to find the position of a specific element in a list.

### Program Overview
The program performs the following steps:

Creates an empty list called my_list.

Appends 10, 20, 30, and 40 to the list.

Inserts the value 15 at the second position.

Extends the list with [50, 60, 70].

Removes the last element from the list.

Sorts the list in ascending order.

Finds and displays the index of the value 30.

### How to Run
Ensure Python is installed on your system.

Clone or download this repository.

Open a terminal/command prompt in the project folder.
