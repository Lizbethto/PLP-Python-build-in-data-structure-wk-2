Hi! This repository contains a Python program I created as part of a class assignment to practice list operations.
The goal was to get hands-on experience with creating lists, adding and removing items, sorting, and finding the position of a specific value.

Assignment Objective
The main purpose of this task was to:

Learn how to create and modify Python lists.

Practice using built-in list methods like append(), insert(), extend(), pop(), sort(), and index().

Understand how indexing works in lists.

Get more comfortable with step-by-step data manipulation in Python.

What the Program Does
My program:

Creates an empty list called my_list.

Appends 10, 20, 30, and 40 to the list.

Inserts the value 15 at the second position.

Extends the list with another list: [50, 60, 70].

Removes the last element from the list.

Sorts the list in ascending order.

Finds and prints the index of the value 30.

Instructions from the Assignment
We were asked to:

Start with an empty list.

Add specific numbers to it.

Insert a value in the middle.

Extend the list with another list.

Remove the last element.

Sort the list.

Find and display the index of a specific number.

What I Learned
Working on this helped me understand:

How lists store multiple items in Python.

The difference between append() and extend().

How insert() can place an item in any position.

How to sort data in ascending order with sort().

How to find the position of an item with index().

How to Run My Program
To test this program:

Make sure Python is installed on your computer.

Clone or download this repository.

Open your terminal or command prompt in the project folder.

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python list_operations.py
